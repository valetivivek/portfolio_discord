  copy: `I'm Vishnu Vivek Valeti, a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Florida with a passion for building software that is scalable, performant, and accessible. My work spans full-stack development, where I enjoy crafting clean React/Next.js interfaces, robust Go backends, and data-driven applications.

Recently, I supported AI fairness research where I built dashboards and data pipelines used to evaluate vendor models, generating 5,000+ synthetic records and cutting validation time by 30%. Previously, I streamlined academic workflows by 40% with an internal portal and designed dashboards serving 150+ users. I enjoy shipping measurable outcomes, collaborating with cross‑functional teams, and improving systems with a calm, methodical approach.`,
